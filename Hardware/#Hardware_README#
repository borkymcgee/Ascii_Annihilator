Hardware modding instructions:

In this directory you will find two images: front.png and back.png. These correspond with the front and back of the binary blaster, and show the mods required on each side. It is easiest to modify the PCB before constructing the binary blaster, but one can also modify an already constructed binary blaster.

	-If modding an existing binary blaster, desolder and remove the 7-segment displays, the buzzer, the sound switch, and (optionally) the battery connectors. The 7-segments and the buzzer won't be needed, but try not to break the sound switch or the battery connectors

	-Use something hard and sharp to cut through the traces along the red lines in the diagram. An exacto knife or box cutter works well for this, although a thumbtack will work in a pinch. Be careful not to cut any traces not marked in red, and make sure the trace is completely cut, potentially using a continuity tester to check.

	-Use an abrasive to remove the silkscreen and expose the copper where marked in lavender on the diagram. Sandpaper works for this, although I've found the best tool for the job is the rounded end of a pointy knife/fishing hook sharpener like the one seen here [TODO: include an amazon link to a sharpener]. It's best to try not to expose any other traces, but it's not the end of the world if you do.

	-Solder jumper wire where marked in peach on the back of the board. Any thin hookup wire will do for this, although solid core wire works best. try to make the jumpers no longer than necessary, as wires with slack in them can get caught on things, get moved around, and eventually fail from fatigue.

	-If modding a new binary blaster kit that has not been constructed yet, insert the ATmega328 and bend a pin on either corner to keep it in place, but do not solder it down

	-Solder the rest of the pins on the atmega328

	-Bend the pins of the alphanumeric display outward in the pattern shown by alphabend.png [TODO].

	-Solder the alphanumeric display to the pins as shown in front.jpg

	-(Optional) Solder the battery holders to the opposite side of the board as that intended. This is optional but makes holding and playing the game MUCH more comfortable.

	-Flash new firmware using the FTDI
